# Fighter Jet Parallax Mountains Background

This project is a full-screen animated HTML canvas background featuring a fighter jet flying through layered, realistic mountains with depth and atmospheric perspective.

## Features
- Multi-layer **parallax mountains** with realistic shading and haze
- **Shorter front mountains** for better depth perception
- A **fighter jet sprite (`jet.png`)** that flies *between* mountain layers
- Subtle **fog bands** and lighting for realism
- Mouse-responsive motion (jet subtly follows the cursor)
- Automatically resizes to fit any screen
